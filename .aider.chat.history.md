```
Idea: A tool to detect Price Gaps (CME gaps or weekend gaps).
User Goal: Trade the "Gap Fill" strategy (price often returns to fill empty trading zones).
Core Features (MVP):

* Detect difference between Friday Close and Sunday Open (CME Futures).
* Detect gaps on lower timeframes during high volatility.
* Chart overlay showing open gaps.
* Alert when price enters a "Gap Zone".

Development Plan:

1. Connect to CME Bitcoin Futures data (delayed is usually free) and Spot data.
2. Logic: If Open_Current != Close_Previous, mark as Gap.
3. Track status: "Unfilled" vs "Filled".
4. Dashboard showing list of active unfilled gaps and their distance from current price.
5. Push notifications when a gap fill starts.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

I need to edit the app metadata file to update the title and description, and create a new file for the logo image.  
Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can propose the exact changes.

A stylized logo featuring two parallel horizontal bars separated by a visible gap, rendered in a modern flat design with a teal‑to‑blue gradient. A subtle arrow points from the lower bar to the upper bar, indicating the movement of price into the gap. The background is a light gray with a faint geometric pattern, giving the logo a clean, professional look suitable for a trading tool.
