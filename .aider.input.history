+Code the following app
+```
+Idea: A tool to detect Price Gaps (CME gaps or weekend gaps).
+User Goal: Trade the "Gap Fill" strategy (price often returns to fill empty trading zones).
+Core Features (MVP):
+
+* Detect difference between Friday Close and Sunday Open (CME Futures).
+* Detect gaps on lower timeframes during high volatility.
+* Chart overlay showing open gaps.
+* Alert when price enters a "Gap Zone".
+
+Development Plan:
+
+1. Connect to CME Bitcoin Futures data (delayed is usually free) and Spot data.
+2. Logic: If Open_Current != Close_Previous, mark as Gap.
+3. Track status: "Unfilled" vs "Filled".
+4. Dashboard showing list of active unfilled gaps and their distance from current price.
+5. Push notifications when a gap fill starts.
